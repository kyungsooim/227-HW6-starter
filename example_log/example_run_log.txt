------- Example Run with choice 1 --------------

Welcome to Huffman Compressor!

Which file would you like to work with (it must be a txt file)? spec-simple-example.txt

Would you like to:
	(1) Make a huffman code,
	(2) Compress a file,
	(3) Decompress a file, or
	(4) Do a compression followed by a decompression.
Type a number from 1 through 4 : 1
I am about to make the Huffman code for spec-simple-example.txt...
	I built up a frequency table of the characters in your file.
	Now, I'm going to call your HuffmanCode(int[]) constructor using that frequency table.
	Okay!  Now, I am going to save the code (using your save method) to the file spec-simple-example.code!
...I am done making the Huffman Code!

I am about to attempt to DECOMPRESS spec-simple-example.short:
	To do this, I must first read in the huffman code used to compress the file.
	I will use your HuffmanCode(Scanner) constructor!
	Now, I will decompress the file using your translate() method and display it on the console
